  This is an example of how the state requestor items can be used as a standard 
  field, or re-defined in a user-defined dictionary which allows the individual 
  variables to be accessed...

<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>
        <Item naaccrId="stateRequestorItems">123ABC                                 etc...</Item>
    </Patient>
</NaaccrDataExchange>

<!-- This assumes that a user-dictionary is availabe and it defines the stateRequestorItems as a group 
     and the two new user-defined variables -->
<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>
        <Item naaccrId="myVariable1">123</Item>
        <Item naaccrId="myVariable2">ABC</Item>
    </Patient>
</NaaccrDataExchange>

  This interesting thing about this is what happend when reading a flat file into an 
  XML? Do we need to retain the full stateRequestorItems (the 1,000 characters). It's 
  tempting to just say no, but remember that it's just a regular group field, and that 
  the Metafile edits use the other group values...

  I understand why we want "naaccrId" and "naaccrNumber" in the dictionary; I am 
  not sure I understand why we want them that way in the data. I don't think a lot 
  of people are going to open the XML in text editor (well, maybe out of curiosity, 
  but not to really do something with the XML); and if they do, I don't think there 
  would be any confusion with seing "id" and/or "num" instead. That would help with 
  the file size issues that's coming our way soon.

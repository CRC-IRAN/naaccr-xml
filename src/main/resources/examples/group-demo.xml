  This example demonstrates how the groups look like in XML; the important think 
  to understand is that the library will read the XML as it is provided to it, and 
  write the patients as they are provided. That means if the XML doesn't contain the 
  group value, but only the children values, then the patient will end up with only 
  the children. I think it's fine; if an application requires a more complex process
  (like recreating the group from the children or vice-versa), then it will be the 
  application's responsibility to post-process the patients...

<!-- only the children are provided in the XML (most common scenario I think) -->
<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>
        <Item naaccrId="">00000001</Item>
        <Tumor>
            <Item naaccrId="histologyIcdO3">8000</Item>
            <Item naaccrId="behaviorIcdO3">3</Item>
        </Tumor>
    </Patient>
</NaaccrDataExchange>

<!-- only the group is provided in the XML-->
<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>
        <Item naaccrId="">00000001</Item>
        <Tumor>
            <Item naaccrId="morphologyIcdO3">80003</Item>
        </Tumor>
    </Patient>

<!-- both group and children are provided (this will be needed for running Metafile edits) -->
<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>

<!-- what about this example? -->
<NaaccrDataExchange naaccrVersion="140" recordType="I">
    <Patient>
        <Item naaccrId="">00000001</Item>
        <Tumor>
            <Item naaccrId="morphologyIcdO3">80003</Item>
            <Item naaccrId="histologyIcdO3">8010</Item>
            <Item naaccrId="behaviorIcdO3">3</Item>
        </Tumor>
    </Patient>
</NaaccrDataExchange>

  On major issue I have with the groups is that apparently NAACCR defines the groups
  has being the real field, and the children as being "shadow" field. That seems to 
  indicate that when writing a flat file, only the groups should be written. But 
  it's clear that the community uses the children, not the groups (except some rare 
  exceptions). So it's must more logical to write the children and not the groups when 
  writing flat files...

  I think the groups are not a good concept and we should try to retire them if we can.
  Duplicating data that way causes TONS of technical issues.  All our SEER softare only 
  deal with the children; but I know for example the Metafile edits use both groups 
  and children. Maybe we can convinced people to re-write the few edits that use them, and 
  to retire those groups items (or if not retired, they would at least be totally ignored 
  by the library; not read, not written, not handled in any way other that documentation...

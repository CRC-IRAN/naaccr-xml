  Do we want to encorce an order? This was an opened question and I am not sure
  it was resolved. Things have changed though; the XSD schema no longers "knows" 
  about individual items, it just knows there are a bunch of them. We won't be 
  able to enforce the order in the XSD. So if we do want the order, we will need 
  to add special code to the library to validate that. I say we leave that alone 
  for now; there won't be any order...

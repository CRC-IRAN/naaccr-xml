  Here is an example with an item outside of the patient tags, and another version 
  where it is added as an attribute instead...
  Some items like vendor name makes a lot of sense. What about the NAACCR version 
  and the record type? Do they belong in those extra items, or are they better 
  as attribute? Currently, the Java library requires the users to provide both 
  before starting to read the file; there is a utility method to extract the two 
  attributes though...
